<p align="center">
During my time at <strong>VPKBIET Tech & Drone Club</strong>, I had the opportunity to collaborate with an enthusiastic team to build innovative aerial systems that pushed boundaries and amazed our peers. We designed and built functional drones from scratch, hosted tech webinars to share knowledge on emerging technologies, mentored juniors, and competed in multiple hackathons and state-level competitions ‚Äî even bringing home a few wins. These projects not only honed our technical skills but also helped us understand the real-world application of engineering, coding, and teamwork. Our efforts extended to developing custom in-house control software, real-time monitoring dashboards, and mission automation tools that reflected the interdisciplinary nature of modern drone systems.

<p align="center"><i>
3D printed PLA drone designed in-house, capable of carrying and deploying payloads up to 3kg ‚Äî built for smart surveillance and obstacle-aware navigation.
</i></p>

<p align="center">
This drone was one of our most stable and high-performing builds. Designed entirely in-house and 3D printed using PLA, it was built to lift payloads up to 3kg. It housed a Raspberry Pi with a camera module to capture live video, which was processed onboard to detect and analyze terrain in real time ‚Äî helping the drone avoid obstacles during flight. We integrated servo motors for controlled payload release, enabling automated drop missions. With a flight time of around 16 minutes, it also supported "Return to Home" mode for safety and recovery in unpredictable situations.  
<br><br>
To make it even more powerful, we developed in-house software to visualize flight data, calibrate sensors, and execute delivery routines using a custom ground control dashboard. The flight stability, custom payload mechanics, and smart features made this one of our most successful and advanced drone builds.

</p>

<p align="center"><i>
A lightweight VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) prototype designed for long-duration missions using minimal power.
</i></p>

<p align="center">
This VTOL aircraft was built using foamboard to drastically reduce weight and improve flight efficiency. The model used just three strategically positioned motors to achieve both vertical lift and horizontal flight, maximizing battery conservation and simplifying the control system. While the foamboard construction limited its payload capacity, the design achieved a flight time of over 24 minutes using a standard LiPo battery ‚Äî making it an ideal platform for extended aerial surveys or lightweight sensing tasks.  
<br><br>
We fine-tuned the control logic for motor thrust balancing, takeoff transitions, and directional stability using open-source flight controller configurations. The aircraft proved stable in low-wind conditions and served as a successful testbed for longer-endurance autonomous flight concepts.

## <p align="center">üåæ Robust Microfiber Drone for Agricultural Surveillance</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center"><i>
Built for real-world endurance ‚Äî a microfiber-based drone designed for large-scale agricultural monitoring in challenging conditions.
</i></p>

<p align="center">
This drone was built using microfiber composite materials to maximize durability and minimize damage during rough weather and unavoidable crash scenarios. The lightweight yet highly impact-resistant body frame made it ideal for long-duration missions over large farms, where terrain and weather often introduce unpredictable variables.  
<br><br>
Equipped with a Pixhawk flight controller, the drone offered flexible flight configurations and allowed precise task assignment for autonomous or semi-autonomous missions. This specific model was later adapted for agricultural surveillance over one of the largest commercial farms in India, where it proved invaluable for crop monitoring, area mapping, and early-stage health analysis. Its robustness and adaptability made it one of our most field-ready and in-demand platforms.

# <p align="center">üõ†Ô∏è 3D-Robotics-Prints</p>

<p align="center">
Custom-designed and 3D printed chassis and parts for aerial and ground robots, including modular drone bodies, rovers, and protective frames.
</p>

<br>

<p align="center">
During my hands-on exploration of robotics and prototyping, I designed and 3D printed multiple drone and rover components using a Flashforge 3D printer. I primarily used PLA and HDPE filaments, carefully designing the parts in AutoCAD and Google SketchUp to achieve a perfect balance between durability and weight. These projects represent my passion for hardware innovation and functional design applied in real-world robotics.

<p align="center">
This 3D printed rover is inspired by India‚Äôs Chandrayaan mission and designed to resemble the Pragyan rover. It features a fully custom-built body that‚Äôs both sturdy and modular, making it easy to upgrade or modify. The rover runs on four geared motors, allowing it to make smooth circular turns and navigate different surfaces with ease. A camera mounted on the front captures images, which are processed using MATLAB to analyze terrain and surroundings. The entire system was coded to simulate real-world exploration tasks, making it a great hands-on project for learning robotics, image processing, and autonomous navigation.

</i></p>

<p align="center">
To protect the drone's propellers during sudden crashes and collisions with unpredictable surfaces, I designed and printed custom propeller guards using AutoCAD. These guards are lightweight yet highly durable, allowing the drone to withstand minor impacts without damaging the blades. The design balances aerodynamic efficiency with robust protection, ensuring optimal flight performance while racing or testing in rugged environments. This upgrade significantly increases the drone‚Äôs resilience, making it ideal for aggressive maneuvering and training scenarios.

<p align="center"><i>
3D printed ultra-light drone bodies designed for extended flight time and efficient lift with small-capacity batteries.
</i></p>

<p align="center">
To build drones with better flight efficiency on limited power, I designed and printed these mini and micro drone bodies using PLA material. The designs were optimized in AutoCAD to strike the right balance between structural strength and weight reduction, critical for drones with low payload capacity. Every frame was carefully structured to be as minimal as possible without compromising durability, ensuring the drones could carry small batteries while maximizing airtime. These bodies are ideal for indoor drone development, obstacle-course training, and lightweight surveillance experimentation.
