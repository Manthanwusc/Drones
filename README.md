During my time at <strong>VPKBIET Tech & Drone Club</strong>, I had the opportunity to collaborate with an enthusiastic team to build innovative aerial systems that pushed boundaries and amazed our peers. We designed and built functional drones from scratch, hosted tech webinars to share knowledge on emerging technologies, mentored juniors, and competed in multiple hackathons and state-level competitions â€” even bringing home a few wins. These projects not only honed our technical skills but also helped us understand the real-world application of engineering, coding, and teamwork. Our efforts extended to developing custom in-house control software, real-time monitoring dashboards, and mission automation tools that reflected the interdisciplinary nature of modern drone systems.

<p align="center"><i>
3D printed PLA drone designed in-house, capable of carrying and deploying payloads up to 3kg â€” built for smart surveillance and obstacle-aware navigation.
</i></p>

<p align="center">
This drone was one of our most stable and high-performing builds. Designed entirely in-house and 3D printed using PLA, it was built to lift payloads up to 3kg. It housed a Raspberry Pi with a camera module to capture live video, which was processed onboard to detect and analyze terrain in real time â€” helping the drone avoid obstacles during flight. We integrated servo motors for controlled payload release, enabling automated drop missions. With a flight time of around 16 minutes, it also supported "Return to Home" mode for safety and recovery in unpredictable situations.  
<br><br>
To make it even more powerful, we developed in-house software to visualize flight data, calibrate sensors, and execute delivery routines using a custom ground control dashboard. The flight stability, custom payload mechanics, and smart features made this one of our most successful and advanced drone builds.

</p>

<p align="center"><i>
A lightweight VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) prototype designed for long-duration missions using minimal power.
</i></p>

<p align="center">
This VTOL aircraft was built using foamboard to drastically reduce weight and improve flight efficiency. The model used just three strategically positioned motors to achieve both vertical lift and horizontal flight, maximizing battery conservation and simplifying the control system. While the foamboard construction limited its payload capacity, the design achieved a flight time of over 24 minutes using a standard LiPo battery â€” making it an ideal platform for extended aerial surveys or lightweight sensing tasks.  
<br><br>
We fine-tuned the control logic for motor thrust balancing, takeoff transitions, and directional stability using open-source flight controller configurations. The aircraft proved stable in low-wind conditions and served as a successful testbed for longer-endurance autonomous flight concepts.

## <p align="center">ðŸŒ¾ Robust Microfiber Drone for Agricultural Surveillance</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center"><i>
Built for real-world endurance â€” a microfiber-based drone designed for large-scale agricultural monitoring in challenging conditions.
</i></p>

<p align="center">
This drone was built using microfiber composite materials to maximize durability and minimize damage during rough weather and unavoidable crash scenarios. The lightweight yet highly impact-resistant body frame made it ideal for long-duration missions over large farms, where terrain and weather often introduce unpredictable variables.  
<br><br>
Equipped with a Pixhawk flight controller, the drone offered flexible flight configurations and allowed precise task assignment for autonomous or semi-autonomous missions. This specific model was later adapted for agricultural surveillance over one of the largest commercial farms in India, where it proved invaluable for crop monitoring, area mapping, and early-stage health analysis. Its robustness and adaptability made it one of our most field-ready and in-demand platforms.
